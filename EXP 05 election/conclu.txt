When put into practice, the Ring Algorithm provides a useful example of how a
distributed system chooses a new coordinator in case the existing one fails. Each process
establishes an active list by communicating with its surrounding processes through an election
procedure. The algorithm selects the process with the highest ID as the new coordinator by
repeatedly sending messages and comparing process IDs. This technique highlights the
robustness and reliability of the distributed election algorithm by ensuring that cooperation
within the system continues without interruption even in the event of a failure.
