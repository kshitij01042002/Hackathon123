In distributed systems, the Ricart-Agrawala method performs well in ensuring
mutual exclusion. It accomplishes this by allowing nodes to gain exclusive access to crucial
portions without the need for a central coordinator by using a token-passing system inside a
logical ring. This method does away with the need for handshake messages, which effectively
lessens the risk of starvation and lowers overhead. However, issues such as token loss and ring
reconstruction after process crashes still exist. However, through efficient token management
and logical coordination, the method guarantees mutual exclusion, which permits distributed
processes to access resources in unison.
