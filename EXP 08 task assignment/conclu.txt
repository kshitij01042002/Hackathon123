Tasks are distributed evenly among resources, such as servers or processors, by
round-robin task assignment, which reduces overloading and increases productivity. However, it
may not be appropriate for activities with varying levels of complexity or priority, as it does not
account for resource capacities or workload. More sophisticated load balancing techniques can
be required in dynamic contexts to ensure the best possible work allocation.
