Lamport's algorithm is a technique in computer science used for assigning
timestamps in distributed systems to ensure the ordering and causality of events. This
method involves each process incrementing its own timestamp when an event occurs and
updating it according to messages received from other processes. By utilizing Lamport
timestamps, a distributed system can establish a partial order of events, facilitating the
analysis of causality and coordination between processes.
