Socket programming enables processes to exchange data either over a
network or within the same machine, offering a versatile solution for inter-process
communication (IPC). Unlike alternative IPC methods such as shared memory or
message queues, sockets provide flexibility and compatibility across different systems
and programming languages. In socket programming, processes communicate by sending
and receiving messages through network endpoints called sockets. These messages carry
data payloads, such as text or binary information, along with pertinent details like source
and destination addresses. Sockets accommodate both connection-oriented and
connectionless communication models, offering flexibility in designing IPC solutions.
