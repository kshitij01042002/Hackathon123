In conclusion, socket programming was used by the client to access the server's
services. Sockets are network connections that allow messages to be sent back and forth between
the client and server. The communication starts when the client sends a service request to the
server, which responds to the request after processing it. Through this communication, the client
can use different features or resources provided by the server, such getting data or carrying out
particular operations. The client can communicate with the server and make use of its services by
connecting via sockets.
